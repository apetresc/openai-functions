Welcome to openai-functions's documentation!
============================================


The ``openai-functions`` library simplifies the usage of OpenAI's function calling feature. It abstracts away the complexity of parsing function signatures and docstrings by providing developers with a clean and intuitive interface.

Where to start
--------------

Either way, you'll want to install ``openai-functions``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install openai-functions

There are three main ways of using it after that:

* To use the AI as an assistant, start by reading the :ref:`your-first-conversation` section.
* To use the AI for direct function calls, e.g. for data extraction, read the :ref:`extracting-data` section.
* To just use the AI to generate schemas and parse OpenAI function calls, read the :ref:`just-generating-the-schemas` section.
